<h1 align="center">Welcome to 8-puzzle üëã</h1>
<p>
</p>

> Solve 8-puzzle using search algorithms, including BFS, DFS, A*, IDA* in python. The output of results will be written into a csv file.
> bfs (Breadth-First Search)
> dfs (Depth-First Search)
> ast (A-Star Search)
> ida (Iterative-Deepening-ŒëStar Search) 

## Usage

Run the main function in the ipynb or the py to test. You can change the dir of the puzzles in .src/SlidingBlocks/examples/

You change the algorithms and heuristic functions (0,1,2)

Part of the output:
```text
----------------------------------
Implementing BFS
----------------------------------
Read the file 3x3_7
----------------------------------
It is a 3 X 3 sliding-tile puzzle
----------------------------------
The initial state is  [2, 5, 4, 0, 3, 1, 6, 8, 7]
----------------------------------
Starting time is  2021-09-26 17:58:59
----------------------------------
Ending time is  2021-09-26 17:58:59
----------------------------------
A puzzle effectively solved
----------------------------------
```

Puzzle file example: 
```text
3
1 2 5
3 4 8
6 7 0
AStar steps: 4
```
